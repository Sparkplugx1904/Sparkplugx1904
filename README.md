### 👋 Hi there! I'm @Sparkplugx1904

I'm passionate about **communication networks** and love diving deep into how the internet really works behind the scenes.  
Currently, I'm exploring the worlds of **Python**, **NodeJS**, **C**, and **C++**, and building tools that test, monitor, or challenge the limits of modern networking.

🛠️ One of my favorite personal projects is **NetBench** – a network benchmarking tool that helps simulate real-world internet conditions.

💡 I sometimes build simple things on my own, but I also enjoy jumping into team collaborations when possible, especially if it's about **AI** or **communication systems**.
